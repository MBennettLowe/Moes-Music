A music database
Enter the songs you own
Enter the songs youâ€™d like to play
Store the song info, images and links to Youtube



I'm committing to ending the tutorial loop and finally work on my first project. 
I'm interested in creating an App that consists of all of my music which is currently on a dying iPod.
The App will have a search feature and use Cards and API's to display the songs title, image and link to YouTube.  I'm interested in using Express, Node and Mongodb.
What's the best way for me to import my songs into a db? 
Do I have to type out each song name and pass it within a POST request?

1. Exported Itunes library as .XML file - Learned that exported data is not in true XML format
2. Converted .XML to JSON using XML2js package - Learned that this package converted to a JSON Object. JSON property names must be double-quoted strings. Used JSON.stringify.

3. Learn how to clean up XML file and extract desired content - Got sample XML in correct format and created some test examples
4. Learn how to clean up converted JSON file to add to a file. Looking for data to have the valid strucure of {key: data}

5. Then create file for JSON data to save persistently. Add to converted data to Library.JSON
